# ComputerVision-GujaratiRecognition
## Abstract
- The aim of this research is to automatize handwritten
attendance data entries in digital form with a minimal
human intervention using Handwritten Character Recognition
(HCR). Here, all the preprocessing techniques (Image Registration,
Cropping, Erosion. Dilation, Noise removal, Line removal,
Segmentation), and classification technique are implemented
in the MATLAB platform. Various types of techniques for
recognition of handwritten digits and characters have been
implemented for different applications. Handwritten entries in
the attendance sheet are classified using Structural Similarity
Measurement (SSIM). The proposed system has achieved a
95.60% classification accuracy
