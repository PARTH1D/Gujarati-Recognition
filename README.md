# ComputerVision-GujaratiRecognition
## Abstract
- The aim of this research is to construct
handwritten Gujarati characters’ dataset as well as their
recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) is an electronic
translation of handwritten text to editable machine text. It is
more challenging due to lots of variation in writing style,
characters’ thickness, and curves of different age groups. The
dataset is collected from the primary school in Gujarat, India
and preprocessed in MATLAB using various techniques, such
as Segmentation, Equalization, Skeletonization, Dilation, and
Merging. Deep Learning techniques can be utilized to overcome
the various challenges which are faced while recognizing
handwritten characters. Therefore, CNN with Dropouts,
Augmentation and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is employed
as classifier. The proposed system has achieved maximum
training accuracy of 98.6% and testing accuracy of 94.8%
